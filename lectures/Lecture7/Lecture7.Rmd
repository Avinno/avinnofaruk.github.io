## Lecture 7 : Market Efficiency and the Behavioral Critique
</section>



---

# Refresher

* Recall our last lectures suggested a number of failures of the CAPM (small cap, value, momentum)
* One response has been the advent of factor models
* Characteristics of stocks which generate alpha can be better represented as factor exposures
    - i.e. small stocks returns driven by factor sensitivity and the SMB risk premium
    
    
---

# Anomalies: risks or opportunities?

* Note the theme:
    - Shares are generally correctly priced
    - Risk-premia paid on assets represent exposure to risk facors
    - Otherwise, "arbitrageurs" will quickly drive prices to equilibrium
    
* *No free lunch* $\longrightarrow$ high-returns = high risk

---

# Market Efficiency

* These ideas are closely associated with the efficient market hypothesis (EMH)
    - Specifically, EMH posits that prices reflect all available information
* The EMH comes in three flavors:
    1. Weak form: all available information is limited to historical prices
    2. Semi-strong form: all available data refers to all publicly available data
    3. Strong form: all available information includes insider information
    
---

# Examples (weak form)

* Weak form: all available information is limited to historical prices

* Empirical evidence shows that using historical data, we can predict:
    1. Short-run reversals
    2. medium momentum
    3. long-term reversals

* More recently evidence on return seasonals (Heston Sadka 2008)

* In the longer run, there is definitely return predictability...but that doesn’t necessarily imply markets are inefficient

# Examples (semi-strong)

- Da, Engelberg, and Gao (2010 and 2011) showed that it took time for markets to recognize value in new public information produced by Google trends

- Google search volume based on products predicted earnings better than both analyst forecasts and earnings announcement returns

- Search volume also proxied for retail investor interest:
    - An increase predicts higher stock prices in the next 2 weeks and an eventual price reversal within the year. 
    - It also contributes to the large first-day return and long-run underperformance of IPO stocks.

# The Behavioral Critique 

* In contrast to the EMH, behavioral view suggests prices may be wrong

* Two departures from the EMH:
    1. Irrational investors
    2. Limits to arbitrage
    
* This leads to investors who make systematic errors in pricing securities, and ensures that attempts to exploit/correct mispricings are risky or costly

---

# The Behavioral Critique

* Let's begin with "investor irrationality"
* Some key ideas about how investors may behave irrationally
    - Overconfidence
    - Representativeness
    - Inattention
    
    
---

# Overconfidence

* Two types:
    1. Overprecision
        * People are too confident in the accuracy of their beliefs
        * 90% confidence intervals contain correct answers less than 50% of the time
    2. Overplacement
        * Overly rosy views of their abilities
        * In surveys, 90% believe themselves to be above the median on various dimensions
        
---

# Overconfidence: Applications

* View in finance research: excessive trading by individual (retail) investors
* Barber and Odean (2002) show male traders trade more and do worse 
    - Psychological studies suggest men more prone to overconfidence
* Grinblatt and Keloharju (2009) combine trading data with psychological tests of overconfidence
    - Overconfidence linked to intensity of trading activity

# Representativeness

* People extrapolate past trends too far into the future

* Just because a firm has seen high growth for past five years does not necessarily mean it will continue

* In revising their beliefs, individuals tend to overweight recent information and underweight prior (or base rate) data.
    * "The predicted value is selected so that the standing of the case in the distribution of outcomes matches its standing in the distribution of impressions" (Kahnemann and Tversky)
    
---

# Representativeness: Applications

* Representativeness predicts long‐run mean reversion in stock returns (De Bondt and Thaler (1985)): 

* Exercise: 
    1. Take a three year period and rank stocks on their performance
over that period
    2. Form a "losers" ("winners") portfolio of the 30 worst-performing (best-performing) stocks, and hold for three years
    3. Repeat process three years later

* Result: past winners do poorly, past losers rebound
    - Note: observe short term momentum, but long‐run reversals

# Other examples of over‐extrapolation

* Value premium may reflect over‐extrapolation about future growth rates

* Low book‐to‐market firms priced based on expectations that recent growth will continue

* Growth stocks tend to disappoint in earnings announcements

* Earnings disappointments more severe for growth stocks

```

---

# Inattention

* People have limited capacity for gathering and processing information
    - Application: Post‐earnings announcement drift
    - After earnings surprises, returns drift for as long as 60 days
        - Larger for Friday announcements
        - Larger for firms announcing at same time as other firms
* See also Niessner (2014), Cohen Frazzini (2008)

# Question: Why don’t “arbitrageurs” exploit mispricing?

* The second piece of the behavioral framework
    - "limits to arbitrage"
    - Recall our willingness to take active positions is driven by not just opportunity, but by the idiosyncratic risk associated with the reward
    - E.g. Treynor-black:
    $$
    w_{i}^{0} = \frac{\alpha_{i} / \sigma_{i}^{2}(\epsilon)}{\sum_{j}\alpha_{j} / \sigma_{j}^{2}(\epsilon)}
    $$

# Why don’t “arbitrageurs” exploit mispricing?

* Royal Dutch and Shell Transport merge interests, but continue to trade separately in the Netherlands and the UK

```

* Note: a long‐short position is risky (why?)
    - Behavioral biases generating mispricing may get worse, not better

# Behavioral Finance and the EMH

* Anomalies reflect a failure in the efficient markets / rational investor model
* Behavioral finance may provides answers, based on known biases from cognitive psychology
