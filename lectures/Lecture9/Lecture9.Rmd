## Lecture 9 : Private Equity
</section>

# Alternative Investments Introduction

* Let's broaden the scope of the investable universe
    - Private equity, hedge funds, fixed income and derivatives

* Everything we learned in first half of class applies, but...
    - Data is more opaque
    - Liquidity is a bigger issue
    - Institutional details matter more
        * E.g. Lock-up periods, redemption, fee structure
    - Efficiency (maybe?)

---

# Private Equity

* What is Private Equity (PE)?

* A PE fund is a financial intermediary typically formed as limited partnerships
    - General Partner (GP): Manage funds, make investments
    - Limited Partners (LPs): Passive investors (pension funds, endowments)

* A PE fund invests only in private (or soon-to-be-private) companies
    - Costs: information asymmetry and illiquidity
    - Benefits: control

---

# Private Equity

* A PE fund takes an *active* role in the firm
    - Added value through management/monitoring
    
* A PE fund has an exit strategy
    - Because of illquidity of investment, targets must provide a clear path to exit (e.g. IPO or sale to another company)
    - Funds are closed-end with lifespans of 10-12 years
        - Commitments raised
        - Capital calls/investments made
        - "Harvesting" period

# Venture Capital

# What value does Venture Capital add?

1. Screening:
    * VCs as winner-pickers -- select 1-in-400 deals to fund
    * Do VCs bet the jockey or the horse?
    * High management turnover suggests the horse
2. Advising/Monitoring:
    * Requires control rights
    * Investments typically include voting rights, board seats, esp. in bad times
3. Exit

*Important to have good VCs for good returns!*

# Buyout Funds

* In contrast to VC, (Leveraged) Buyout (BO) funds focus on established firms

* Firms are either private to begin with, or are taken private (as in a management buyout)

* Large amounts of *new* debt are used to finance the repurchase of existing equity
    - Often 90/10 debt-to-equity ratio in new company
    - Example: RJR Nabisco, Dell

---

# Buyout Funds

* Where does the value-add come from?
    - No need to take company private to exploit an undervalued stock
    - Similar to VC, control must matter
* What types of things do LBO firms do once they have control that adds value?
    - Spin-offs of conglomerates
        - Beatrice Foods
    - Efficiency gains (cost-cutting, union negotiations, layoffs)
        - Safeway

# Private Equity Fund Contracts

* Incentives of GPs and LPs may not always be aligned

* GPs may have incentives to shirk or take excessive risk

* Fees, co-investment by fund managers and covenants discipline GPs and protect the LPs

---

# Private Equity Fund Contracts

* *Fees* include a flat rate (1-3%) plus 20-30% performance fee

* *Co-investment*: General partners often required to personally invest in the funds (typically GP invests 1%)

* *Covenants*: e.g. restrictions on activities

* Table reports mean, median, standard deviations and 25-75th percentile of dollar weighted returns (IRR) to PE funds
    - Why dollar-weighted returns?
    - On average, roughly equivalent to S&P500 during same period (net of fees)
    
---

# Private Equity Performance

* How to identify good private equity funds?

* Pick past winners! (What?)

* Returns to private equity are highly persistent (Why?)

* Issue: everyone wants to get in funds with strong performance
    - Who gets access?
    - What incentive effects does this create?

# Private Equity Performance

## Determinants of fund performance (Private Market Equivalents)

* General Partner (PE funds) performance is persistent

# Private Equity Performance and Other Issues

* Often the binding constraint for successful PE funds is investment opportunities, not investors

* Leads to money-chasing-deals phenomenon

* During periods of high flows into private equity, funds pay higher valuations for their acquisitions
